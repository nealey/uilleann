/** FMOperator defines all settable paramaters to an operator.
 *
 * An FM operator consists of:
 * - An input
 * - An oscillator
 * - An envelope generator
 *
 * Frequency Modulation happens by chaining oscillators together,
 * using the output of one to modulate the frequency of the next.
 *
 * Oscillators generate waveforms in a shape defined by
 * `synth_waveform.h`. WAVEFORM_SINE is a good one to start with.
 * Other sensible options are SAWTOOTH, SQUARE, and TRIANGLE.
 *
 * Frequency for an oscillator is calculated with:
 *     offset + (voiceFrequency Ã— multiplier)
 *
 * Oscillator frequency is then modulated by the level obtained
 * by the input mixer: level of 1.0 shifts frequency up by
 * 8 octaves, level of -1.0 shifts frequency down by 8 octaves.
 *
 * The envelope modifies amplitude of the oscillator output,
 * using the following rules:
 * - stay at 0 until Note On
 * - stay at 0 for `delayTime` milliseconds
 * - linear increase to `holdAmplitude` for `attackTime` milliseconds
 * - stay at `holdAmplitude` for `holdTime` milliseconds
 * - linear decrease to `sustainAmplitude` for `decayTime` milliseconds
 * - stay at `sustainAmplitude` until Note Off
 * - linear decrease to 0 for `releaseTime` milliseconds

/** FMPatch defines all parameters to a voice patch.
 *
 * This defines the "sound" of an FM voice,
 * just like a "Patch" does in a hardware synthesizer.
 * I think of a "patch" being the physical cables that
 * connect oscillators together, and to the output mixer.
 *
 * Each operator has NUM_OPERATORS input gains,
 * one output gain (to the voice output mixer),
 * and NUM_OPERATORS operators.
 *
 * Historical FM synthisizers,
 * such as the DX7 or DX9,
 * used "algorithms" to patch operators into one another:
 * this is done with 0.0 or 1.0 values to the gains.
 * The "feedback" on operator 4 of the DX9
 * can be accomplished by patching an operator into itself.
