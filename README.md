Uilleann
=======

This is my work to model a 3D printable Uilleann Pipe full set.

I need a better name for this project.


Printing Advice
=============

Reeds
------

The Daye drones feature 3D printable reeds,
based on the laudable work of Animatorgeek.
Reeds need to simulate natural cane,
so the following print settings should be used on every reed:

Fill pattern: Aligned Rectilinear  
Fill density: 100%  
Fill angle: 90Â°  
Bottom solid layers: 0  
Layer height: 0.05  
Perimiters: 1  
Seam position:  Aligned (or whatever gets seams off the reed and onto the base)  
Top solid layers: 0  

Some light sanding may be required after printing.

Daye
====

Based on David Daye's Budget Drones and Penny Chanter owned by me.
David Daye has published extensive notes on how to recreate his builds
at <https://daye1.com/>, including measurements for these parts.

Rowsome
=======

This is based on the O'Flynn Leo Rewsome set,
documented at pipers.id.

http://pipers.ie/source/section/?sectionId=8 has been invaluable, providing
detailed documentation of measurements of pipes.

Decorations
----------

The diagrams didn't specify exact values for every measurement,
so I took some aesthetic liberties with some parts (mostly decorative ones).

Bump-Outs
----------

I think this chanter has some extra keys that I'm not going to implement,
so I skipped a lot of the bump-out warty things on the side.
