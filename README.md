Uilleann
=======

This is my work to model a 3D printable Uilleann Pipe full set.

I need a better name for this project.


Daye
====

Based on David Daye's Budget Drones and Penny Chanter owned by me.
David Daye has published extensive notes on how to recreate his builds
at <https://daye1.com/>, including measurements for these parts.

Rowsome
=======

This is based on the O'Flynn Leo Rewsome set,
documented at pipers.id.

http://pipers.ie/source/section/?sectionId=8 has been invaluable, providing
detailed documentation of measurements of pipes.

Decorations
----------

The diagrams didn't specify exact values for every measurement,
so I took some aesthetic liberties with some parts (mostly decorative ones).

Bump-Outs
----------

I think this chanter has some extra keys that I'm not going to implement,
so I skipped a lot of the bump-out warty things on the side.
