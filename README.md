http://pipers.ie/source/section/?sectionId=8 has been invaluable, providing
detailed documentation of measurements of pipes.

I based this on the O'Flynn Leo Rowsome set

* [diagrams](http://pipers.ie/source/gallery?galleryId=1353)

Decorations
===========

The diagrams didn't specify exact values for every measurement,
so I took some aesthetic liberties with some parts (mostly decorative ones).

Bump-Outs
=========

I think this chanter has some extra keys that I'm not going to implement,
so I skipped a lot of the bump-out warty things on the side.
